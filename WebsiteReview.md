# Comparison with other website

I am going to compare my Camp China website to 2 other websites, BBC News and Facebbok. On the BBC website, there is a lot more information and pictures on the first page. The information and pictures sits on a white background. On my website, I don't have a lot of images and all the imformation sits on a background image. The BBC website has more than 13 pages, form the home page to the video and pictures page. My website only has 5 pages, Home, About, Gallery, Travel and Shop. On my gallery page, I have a background video that automatically plays when you enter the page.
