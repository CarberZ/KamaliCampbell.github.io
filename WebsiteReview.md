# Website Review 

## Comparison with other website

I am going to compare my Camp China website to 2 other websites, BBC News and Facebbok. On the BBC website, there is a lot more information and pictures on the first page. The information and pictures sits on a white background. On my website, I don't have a lot of images and all the information sits on a background image. The BBC website has more than 13 pages, form the home page to the video and pictures page. My website only has 5 pages, Home, About, Gallery, Travel and Shop. On my gallery page, I have a background video that automatically plays when you enter the page. The only major feature I'm missing from my website that the BBC website has is a sitemap. Sitemaps are very important because it contains a list of the pages for the website. The only thing that stands out between my website and the BBC website is, my website have a header and a footer, the header contains the name of the website and the footer contains the copyright logo. 
Facebbok is a social media website so it will have a lot more imformation than my website. But unlike mine with the background image, facebbok also keep their information and pictures on a white background like BBC's website. Facebook also have a header like my website but the difference between my header and facebook's header is, their header contains the facebook logo, search bar, and some clickable icons. Facebook also has a navigation bar on the left side of the page. 

## Intended Audience and Purpose 

The Camp China Website is aimed at young adults aged 18-25 who wants to work and help the local community. The intended audience is mainly travellers. You don't need a lot of experience to join Camp China, becuase you'll be learning new skills and at the same time you'll be making money. There's a lot of job roles to choose from. So any audience that have a specific skill like cooking or coaching can easily join. The purpose of the Camp China website is, it helps the user understand what camp china is about and by doing this the website aims to tell the user that Camp China is all helping young people travel and seek new opportunities abroad and whhile away, you'll learn new skills and get paid at the same time. 

## Legal Constraints 

There are a lot of legal constraints/rules that are important not to break when it comes to building a website. These legal contraints help prevent people from adding discrimination, offensive stereotypes, Privacy and other issues that are not enforced by the law. So I have to be careful with all the content I add to my website. A good example of taking something that is copyrighted is the Samsung song "Over The Horizon." Since I have a background video on the gallery page, I would like an instrumental playing in the background. A good instrumental to use is the Samsung song and I can easily get it from YouTube. But I can't use this song due to legal constraints. The song is copyrighted by Samsung. Even the person that uploaded the song on YouTube said, "I don't own anything, this song is copyrighted by Samsung." You can get in huge trouble if you end up stealing any content from other companies/people, this is why it's important that I be careful with all the content I add to my website and it's very important to prevent these things from happening.
