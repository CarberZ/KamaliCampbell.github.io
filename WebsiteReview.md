# Website Review 

## Comparison with other website

I am going to compare my Camp China website to 2 other websites, BBC News and Facebbok. On the BBC website, there is a lot more information and pictures on the first page. The information and pictures sits on a white background. On my website, I don't have a lot of images and all the information sits on a background image. The BBC website has more than 13 pages, form the home page to the video and pictures page. My website only has 5 pages, Home, About, Gallery, Travel and Shop. On my gallery page, I have a background video that automatically plays when you enter the page. The only major feature I'm missing from my website that the BBC website has is a sitemap. Sitemaps are very important because it contains a list of the pages for the website. The only thing that stands out between my website and the BBC website is, my website have a header and a footer, the header contains the name of the website and the footer contains the copyright logo. 
Facebbok is a social media website so it will have a lot more imformation than my website. But unlike mine with the background image, facebbok also keep their information and pictures on a white background like BBC's website. Facebook also have a header like my website but the difference between my header and facebook's header is, their header contains the facebook logo, search bar, and some clickable icons. Facebook also has a navigation bar on the left side of the page.
