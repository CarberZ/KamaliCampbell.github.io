# Documentation 

## Intended Audience 

The Camp China Website is aimed at young adults aged 18-25 who wants to work and help the local community. The intended audience is mainly  travellers. You don't need a lot of experience to join Camp China, becuase you'll be learning new skills and at the same time you'll be making money. There's a lot of job roles to choose from. So any audience that have a specific skill like cooking or coaching can easily join. 

## What are you doing? 

I have to create a website for a company called Invasion. I am going to create a camp website for China. I have to make a least 5 pages, the pages I have created are Home, About us, Gallery, Travel and Shop. In the development stage, I have to include a doctype, box model, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Linking HTML and CSS, Responsive website, github hosting and meta tags. I also have to create designs and in the design stage I have to create 8 sketches on paper and 8 designs on computer (photoshop). I must also include mobile and tablet designs. In the designs, I must include tables, forms with buttons and check boxes, navigation menu, interactive components, colour schemes, embeded multimedia, accessibility features and platform compatibility. 

## What are you aiming to achieve? 

I am aiming to make the website very user-friendly. I am trying to make my website easy to navigate around. I want my website to be consitent and flexible meaning you can also go on your mobile phones and tablets. I want my navigation menu to be very different from other websites. I'm going to make my navigation menu vertical and on the gallery page, I am going to add a slide show and a background video on China Landscapes. I am aiming to create unique deisgns on paper on photoshop and most importantly, I am aiming to meet the deadline. 

## Constraints 

There's a lot of contraints that can occur like not having the right resources such as photoshop. When I was creating my design on photoshop, I could have only done it at college becuase I didn't have the software on my laptop. Another constraint of resource is accessing the internet, we have to do a lot of research and most research is from the internet. Another constraint is time, the deadline for this project is December 21st and there's a lot to do other than coding and designing the website it self. I also have to get feedback from others and write a final evaluation. A personal constraint for me is JavaScript, I find it difficult to understand JS. It's very important to add JS to my website because it adds a lot of interactivity to the website.
